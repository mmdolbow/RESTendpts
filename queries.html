			<p>If you've taken the time to learn a little bit about a layer or table in a REST endpoint, the query forms you'll find in one of Esri's are invaluable.
				Let's say you want to see what an example record looks like. Well, just figure out how to find OBJECTID 1, or 1000. Or if you know one column is "Name", 
				figure out how to query for "Smith". You'll know you're successful if you get results at the bottom of the form. And once you have that, you have a URL
				that you can copy and paste into your Javascript code in order to build a dynamic query for your users. All you have to do is switch the format from "html" to "json" and you've
				got something your web app can consume, parse with code, and display to your users.</p>
