 * On Click function for btnQueryRandDemo.
 * Picks a letter of the alphabet at random, and fires a query against the Detailed Counties
 * layer in order to get many results if possible. (Might need to exclude "X", but "Z" works)
 * Need to define the DOM elements to be filled in on click. Also need to define ajax queries
 * with JQuery.
