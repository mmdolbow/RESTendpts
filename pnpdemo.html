			<p>One of the most common questions developers get when it comes to geography is "Can you tell me what (census tract, county, congressional district) my point is in?"
			For the most common geographies, there ARE basic text-based "lookups" for that type of query. But it's not always that straightforward, and often what you want is a
			"Point in Polygon" query. In other words, given a point - represented by coordinates such as lat/long or x/y, tell me which "area" it falls in. When it comes to really
			irregular areas such as watersheds (or some heinously gerrymandered congressional districts), this question is not so easy to answer. But if you have a REST endpoint
			that defines those areas, you can perform a "spatial query" to get the answer relatively easily.	
				</p>
				<p>More coming soon! Right now we have a basic map with only panning options and an overlay. We need to restrict the panning bounds, set up an event listener on pan that will move the marker
					and fire off a query to the service.</p>
