# A tutorial on REST endpoints
This repository is intended to serve as a basic, introductory tutorial on using REST enpoints, using Esri ArcGIS Server REST API as an example (although other browsable RESTful services could also be referenced).

## Goals
1. Explain how a REST endpoint can be explored using a browser, including how links can open services and layers in Javascript or other clients like Arc Desktop or AGOL. (Link to Esri help and training)
2. Demonstrate constructing basic text queries against layers using the built-in HTML forms
3. Demonstrate a point-in-poly javascript query
4. Demonstrate ways to obtain geoJSON from AGOL services or with translators

## Status
Only basic structure built at this time. Needs content creation.
