# A tutorial on REST endpoints
This repository is intended to serve as a basic, introductory tutorial on using REST enpoints, using Esri ArcGIS Server REST API as an example (although other browsable RESTful services could also be referenced). It is NOT intended to be a comprehensive overview of Esri's REST API, AJAX requests, or Javascript. The intended audience is beginner to mid-level web programmers.

## Goals
1. Explain how a REST endpoint can be explored using a browser, including how links can open services and layers in Javascript or other clients like ArcGIS Desktop or AGOL. (Link to Esri help and training)
2. Demonstrate constructing basic text queries against layers using the built-in HTML forms
3. Demonstrate a point-in-poly javascript query, using a Leaflet map that can be dragged around (but not zoomed) within the bounds of an Esri service.
4. Demonstrate ways to obtain geoJSON from AGOL services or with translators
